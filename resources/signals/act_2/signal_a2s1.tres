[[EMPYREAN]] FLEET SHIP TRANSMISSION INTERCEPTED:
COMMANDER [[KIRA PRICE]] // STORMBREAKER

We have established a perimeter into the [[Zulu Sector]], no contact has been made with any [[Vanguard]] forces. One ship has been spotted on the outer edge of our sensor range, they likely know we're coming.

A ship from the fleet has gone missing, the [[Horizon]]. They just disappeared from sensors in a split-second and all communication has been lost. We're maintaining position until we can find out what happened, but the longer we delay, the more time the [[Vanguard]] can move in to stop our push.

Our sensors have been showing the occasional 'phantom' ping ever since we entered the sector, we haven't found what's causing the interference. We know it's not an issue with our systems locally, every ship in the fleet has been affected by it."
