After extensive research into the Zephyr incident, new information has been discovered. The malfunctioning probe Science Officer ({PLAYER_NAME}) was sent to repair contained code that self-propagated to their ships systems mid-jump. From their ship, it was bounced back to the [[Jump Gate]], overriding the destination trajectory, and tapping into deep-nested subroutines that were previously unknown.

From what we can ascertain, a second stream branched off ahead of the Zephyr, with the trajectory and velocity directed to the uncharted [[Echo Sector]], likely where the Zephyr ended up.

We don't know who tampered with the probe, it's unlikely to be the [[Empyrean]] as they have no access to the [[Jump Gate]], unless there has been major technological discoveries made in the [[Delta Sector]] that we are unaware of.

Until further notice ALL use of the [[Jump Gate]] has been suspended."
